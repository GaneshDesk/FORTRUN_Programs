!A procedure is a group of statements that perform a well-defined task and can be invoked from your program. Information (or data) is passed to the calling program, to the procedure as arguments.

!There are two types of procedures âˆ’
!1.Functions: 
!	A function is a procedure that returns a single quantity. A function should not modify its arguments.
!	The returned quantity is known as function value, and it is denoted by the function name.

!2.Subroutines:
!	A subroutine does not return a value, however it can modify its arguments.

program calling_func

   real :: a
   a = area_of_circle(2.0) 
   
   Print *, "The area of a circle with radius 2.0 is"
   Print *, a
   
end program calling_func


! this function computes the area of a circle with radius r  
function area_of_circle (r)  

! function result     
implicit none      

   ! dummy arguments        
   real :: area_of_circle   
   
   ! local variables 
   real :: r     
   real :: pi
   
   pi = 4 * atan (1.0)     
   area_of_circle = pi * r**2  
   
end function area_of_circle
